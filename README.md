## Overview

Stress affects millions of people worldwide, and early detection can help mitigate its impact. This project focuses on detecting stress using emotion-based signals derived from data. By analyzing emotional patterns, the system can predict stress levels efficiently.

## Features

- Emotion-based stress detection
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Machine learning model for stress prediction
- Easy-to-follow Jupyter Notebook implementation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eyabesbes/Stress_Detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Stress_Detection
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then use `pip` to install necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If a `requirements.txt` file is not present, manually install libraries as needed (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, etc.).

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Navigate to the notebook files and open the main notebook.

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate results.
